# Current Projects
__General machine learning with Python__

![Clustering](/images/ml-clustering.png)

Members of this project are self-teaching the fundamentals of machine learning in Python, e.g. coding k-means and regression algorithms from scratch. Goals include applying these algorithms to real data and learning the fundamentals of deep learning. Group members: Ben, Azhar, Jesse.

__The SAMPL contest__

The [SAMPL contest](https://github.com/MobleyLab/SAMPL6) is a set of challenges designed to test the latest molecular simulation methods for their ability to predict physical properties of molecules without prior knowledge of the experimental result. Members are interested in writing code to predict pKa values for the SAMPL6 dataset of small molecules, mainly to advance understanding of the underlying chemistry and physics. This will include learning...
* how to convert chemical formulae into 3D structures
* how to generate alternative conformers for molecules
* how to implement (or link out to) a free energy calculation technique

...and much more!
Group members: Christina, Richard, Jude, Sarah.

__Website development__

Building this website and making it prettier. Group member: Luli.

__Coding outreach__

Teaching the fundamentals of coding to D.C. area high school students. See the Outreach tab for more information. Group members: Luli, Christina, Sarah.


# Past Projects
__Machine learning practice with Python and Kaggle__

Becoming exposed to different machine learning concepts by participating in machine learning challenges and exploring datasets available through Kaggle. Examples of practice challenges include: using natural language processing to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate, classifying leaves into respective species using numerical and image data, and classifying breast cancer malignancy based on morphological characteristics of tissue samples. Group members: David, Luli.

__Object recognition using computer vision in OpenCV__

Learning the basics of object recognition using computer vision in OpenCV and moving on to practical applications such as facial recognition, identifying labels on reagents, and reading traffic signals. Group member: Maxim.

__Oxygen tank timer alarm__

Creating an alarm system using an Arduino microcontroller (programmed in C++) that alerts nursing home staff of oxygen tank levels. Group member: Sunmee.

__Raspberry Pi__

Hands on experience with the latest model of Raspberry Pi, convering the basics of electric circuits, including sensors, actuators, resistors, transistors, and more. Group members: Alejandro, Christina.
