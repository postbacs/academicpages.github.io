On the last Wednesday of every month, we partner with [College Bound](http://collegebound.org/) to teach the basics of coding in Python to high school students in the D.C. area. Thank you to our friends at [Girls Who Code (University of Michigan)](https://github.com/GWC-DCMB) for giving us inspiration for our outreach program!
